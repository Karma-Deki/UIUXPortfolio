          <p class="intro-text">
            In my usability studies for the RadianceRealm website, I conducted two rounds of research to gather valuable insights from users. Round 1 revealed challenges with product discovery, checkout process, and community engagement, leading to iterative improvements implemented in Round 2. The findings 
            from these studies informed targeted enhancements to optimize user experience and usability.

            <li class="timeline-text">
                Throughout this project, I've gained valuable insights into the importance of user-centric design and iterative improvement. By conducting usability testing and incorporating user feedback, I learned the significance of empathy in creating meaningful and effective designs. Additionally, collaborating with team members and stakeholders helped me appreciate the iterative nature of the design process 
                and the importance of communication and flexibility in achieving project goals.
